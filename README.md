## Description

So_long is a project at 42 School that involves creating a 2D game using the **MLX42** graphics library.

</p>

The game is a simple maze where the player has to collect all the **collectibles** before reaching the exit, while avoiding **obstacles** such as walls and enemies.

The project requires the use of **input/output, memory allocation**, and **basic algorithms** such as **BFS** (breadth-first search) for pathfinding.

The game must be able to handle various error cases, such as incorrect maps or missing resources, and provide appropriate error messages to the user.

## Usage

``make`` to compile all the functions.

``./so_long maps/42.ber`` to try one of the maps.
